## Let's get acquainted and talk about art and the VAVVOLF project.

A lone wolf in the forest, exploring the world of strange creatures and characters in a crazy world.

Artist VAVVOLF is inspired by Slavic and Scandinavian themes. The wolf has a passion for history and mythology. The wolf constructs a world.


I value `1/1` art and strive to make my art accessible to everyone. I appreciate every collector and every early supporter.
```
I paint darkness. I love darkness. I wear darkness. I listen to darkness. I am comfortable in the darkness. I am a wolf.
```

What goal am I pursuing? I do what I like.

The secondary market is important. And memes too. `I love memes, Lord of the Rings, Blood and Wine.`
